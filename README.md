# TOLocalDeviceDiscovery

This is a small service class I originally built in iComics, but have since pulled it out, and more or less rewrote it for [TOFileKit](https://github.com/TimOliver/TOFileKit).

It is a class that lets you specify which Bonjour services you would like to detect on your local network, and subsequently scan for all of those services with this one central class.

I put it in a separate Xcode project so it was easier to build and test.

I don't intend to make this a fully supported open source library, but let me know if you think I should. :)
